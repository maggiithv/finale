Personalized Study Planner with AI is a smart application that helps students organize their studies effectively.
It tracks syllabus, subjects, and exam dates, then automatically generates a daily or weekly study plan.
The planner adjusts dynamically if a student misses a task and ensures balanced preparation across all subjects.
This project aims to reduce stress and improve productivity by giving students a personalized learning roadmap.
